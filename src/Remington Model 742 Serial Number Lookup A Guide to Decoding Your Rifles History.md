The Remington Model 742 is a semi-automatic rifle that was produced from 1960 to 1980. It is also known as the Woodsmaster, and it was chambered in various calibers, such as .30-06, .308, .243, and .280. The Model 742 was popular among hunters and sport shooters, and it featured a rotary breech block and a detachable box magazine.
 
If you own a Remington Model 742, you might be curious about when it was manufactured. Fortunately, there is a way to find out the date of manufacture by looking at the serial number and the barrel code on your rifle. Here is how to do it:

1. Locate the serial number on your rifle. It is usually stamped on the left side of the receiver, near the ejection port. The serial number may consist of six or seven digits, and it may or may not have a letter prefix.
2. Locate the barrel code on your rifle. It is usually stamped on the left side of the barrel, near the breech. The barrel code consists of two or three letters that indicate the month and year of manufacture.
3. Decode the serial number and the barrel code using the following tables:

| Serial Number Prefix | Year of Manufacture |
| --- | --- |

| No prefix | 1960-1968 |

| A | 1975-1976 |

| B | 1977-1978 |

| C | 1979-1980 |

| D | 1981 (Model 7400) |

| Barrel Code Letter | Month of Manufacture |
| --- | --- |

| B | January |

| L | February |

| A | March |

| C | April |

| K | May |

| P | June |

| O | July |

| W | August |

| D | September |

| E | October |

| R | November |

| X | December |

| Barrel Code Letter(s) | Year of Manufacture (1960-1980) |
| --- | --- |

| C or Z or ZZ or A or B or Y or YY or L or M or N or P or R or S or T or U or W or X or K or G or J or Q or V or H or I or O or E or F or D < td > 1960 - 1980 (see [Remington Society website](https://www.remingtonsociety.org/remington-model-740-model-742-and-model-7400-autoloading-rifles/) for exact year) |

For example, if your rifle has a serial number B123456 and a barrel code OW, it means that it was manufactured in July 1977.
     
Note that some rifles may have been rebarreled with barrels from different years, so the barrel code may not match the serial number. Also note that some rifles may not have a serial number at all, as they were made before 1968 when serial numbers were not required by law.

## The History of the Remington Model 742
 
The Remington Model 742 was developed as a successor to the Model 740, which was Remington's first gas-operated, centerfire rifle. The Model 740 was introduced in 1955 and chambered in .30-06, .308, .244, and .280. It used a tappet gas system that was prone to fouling and jamming, especially with dirty ammunition. The Model 740 also had a complex trigger mechanism that was difficult to service and adjust.

The Model 742 was designed to overcome these problems by using a modified gas system that was more reliable and easier to clean. The Model 742 also had a simpler trigger mechanism that was more consistent and durable. The Model 742 was introduced in December 1959 and chambered in .30-06, .308, .243, and .280. It was available in four grades: A (standard), ADL (deluxe), BDL (custom deluxe), and CDL (carbine deluxe). The Model 742 was also offered in commemorative editions for the 150th anniversary of Remington in 1966, the 100th anniversary of Canada in 1967, and the bicentennial of the United States in 1976.
 
The Model 742 was popular among hunters and sport shooters for its accuracy, power, and ease of use. It featured a rotary breech block that locked into the barrel extension, a side-ejection port that ejected the spent cases away from the shooter's face, and a free-floating barrel that enhanced accuracy. It also had a detachable box magazine that held four rounds (or six rounds for the .243 caliber), a cross-bolt safety that blocked the trigger and sear, and a bolt release button that allowed the bolt to be opened without pulling the trigger. The Model 742 had a walnut stock with a pistol grip and a checkered fore-end and buttplate. It had a ramp front sight and an adjustable rear sight, as well as provisions for mounting a scope.
 
The Model 742 was produced until 1980, when it was replaced by the Model 7400. During its production run, over 1.4 million Model 742 rifles were made. The Model 742 is still widely used and favored by many hunters today, although some parts may be hard to find or replace. The Model 742 is also known for its use by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The IRA smuggled hundreds of Model 742 rifles from the United States and used them as sniper rifles against British security forces.
