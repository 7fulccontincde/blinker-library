In this article, we will show you how to use MapInfo Professional 12.5 for spatial analysis. We will cover some of the basic features and functions of the software, such as creating maps, querying data, performing spatial operations, and exporting results.
 
## Creating Maps
 
To create a map in MapInfo Professional 12.5, you need to have some data in tabular form. You can either import data from various sources, such as Excel, CSV, Access, or ODBC databases, or create your own data using the CAD tools in the software. You can also load image data sets as background mapping, such as satellite imagery, aerial photos, or raster maps.
 
Once you have your data in MapInfo Professional 12.5, you can display it on a map window by selecting the table from the Table List and clicking on the Map button. You can then customize the appearance of your map by changing the symbology, labels, legend, scale bar, and other map elements. You can also add thematic maps to show different attributes of your data using colors, symbols, charts, or regions.
 
## Querying Data
 
One of the most useful features of MapInfo Professional 12.5 is the ability to query your data using SQL commands. You can use the Query menu to access various query options, such as Select by Attributes, Select by Location, SQL Select, Buffer Zones, and Spatial Aggregation. You can also use the Query Builder to create complex queries using a graphical interface.
 
Querying your data allows you to filter out irrelevant information and focus on the data that meets your criteria. For example, you can select all the points that fall within a certain distance from a line, or all the polygons that intersect with another polygon. You can also perform calculations and statistics on your data using aggregate functions, such as Sum, Count, Average, Min, Max, etc.
 
## Performing Spatial Operations
 
Another powerful feature of MapInfo Professional 12.5 is the ability to perform spatial operations on your data using the Overlay menu. You can use various overlay options to combine or modify your data based on their spatial relationships. For example, you can use Intersect to create a new table with only the features that overlap between two tables; or use Erase to remove features from one table that are covered by another table.

Performing spatial operations allows you to create new data sets that reflect your analysis objectives. For example, you can use Union to merge multiple tables into one; or use Dissolve to aggregate features based on a common attribute. You can also use Overlay Analysis to compare different scenarios or alternatives using criteria such as area, perimeter, length, etc.
 
## Exporting Results
 
After you have performed your spatial analysis in MapInfo Professional 12.5, you can export your results to various formats for further processing or presentation. You can use the File menu to access various export options, such as Save Copy As (to save your table as another format), Save Window As (to save your map window as an image file), Print (to print your map window), or Layout Designer (to create a professional-looking layout with multiple map windows and other elements).
 
Exporting your results allows you to share your findings with others or integrate them with other applications. For example, you can save your table as an Excel file and use it for further analysis; or save your map window as a JPEG file and insert it into a PowerPoint presentation.
