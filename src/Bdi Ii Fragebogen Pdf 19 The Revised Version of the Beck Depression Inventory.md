The BDI-II Fragebogen is a German version of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), a self-report questionnaire that measures the severity and symptoms of depression. The BDI-II Fragebogen consists of 21 items, each with four statements that describe different levels of depressive feelings or attitudes. The respondent has to choose the statement that best reflects how they have been feeling during the past two weeks, including today. The statements are scored from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. The total score ranges from 0 to 63, and can be interpreted as follows:
  
- 0-9: No depression
- 10-18: Mild to moderate depression
- 19-29: Moderate to severe depression
- 30-63: Severe depression

The BDI-II Fragebogen can be used for screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of depression in clinical and research settings. It can also be used as a self-help tool for people who want to assess their own mood and seek professional help if needed. The BDI-II Fragebogen has been validated for use in German-speaking populations and has shown good reliability and validity[^1^] [^2^]. It is available online as a PDF file that can be downloaded and printed for free[^3^]. Alternatively, it can be administered online using a web-based platform[^4^].

The BDI-II Fragebogen is a simple and effective way to measure depression and its impact on one's life. However, it is not a substitute for a professional diagnosis or treatment. If you or someone you know is suffering from depression, please seek help from a qualified mental health professional.

## What are the symptoms of depression?
  
Depression is more than just feeling sad or low. It is a serious mental health condition that affects one's thoughts, feelings, behavior, and physical health. Depression can cause a variety of symptoms, such as:

- Lack of interest or pleasure in activities that used to be enjoyable
- Feeling hopeless, worthless, guilty, or helpless
- Having trouble concentrating, remembering, or making decisions
- Feeling tired, restless, irritable, or agitated
- Having changes in appetite, weight, sleep, or energy level
- Having thoughts of death or suicide
- Experiencing physical symptoms such as headaches, stomachaches, or pain

The severity and frequency of these symptoms may vary from person to person and over time. Some people may have mild depression that lasts for a short period of time, while others may have severe depression that lasts for a long time or recurs frequently. Depression can affect anyone, regardless of age, gender, culture, or background.
  
## What are the causes and risk factors of depression?
  
There is no single cause of depression. It is likely the result of a complex interaction of biological, psychological, social, and environmental factors. Some of the possible causes and risk factors of depression include:

- Genetic predisposition or family history of depression
- Brain chemistry or structure abnormalities
- Hormonal changes or imbalances
- Stressful life events such as loss, trauma, abuse, or conflict
- Chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, or cancer
- Substance use or abuse such as alcohol, drugs, or nicotine
- Negative thinking patterns or low self-esteem
- Lack of social support or isolation
- Poor coping skills or difficulty adapting to change

However, not everyone who has these factors will develop depression. Likewise, some people who have no apparent risk factors may still experience depression. Therefore, it is important to recognize the signs and symptoms of depression and seek help when needed.
