## Bug Fixes and Stability Enhancements
 
One of the main goals of FlexSim 6.0.2 was to fix some of the bugs and issues that were reported by users in previous versions. Some of these fixes include:

- Fixed a bug with double-clicking experimenter results to drill down into the dashboard data that the point represents[^1^].
- Fixed a bug that was causing FlexSim to crash when the bundle field names' length exceeded 500 characters[^1^].
- Fixed a bug with automatic state naming in setstate ()[^1^].
- Fixed a bug with the context menu's positioning on code windows[^1^].
- Fixed nodeinsertafter ()'s return value[^1^].
- Fixed a speed issue when resetting a model in Windows XP[^1^].
- Stopping the model now updates the content statistics on objects[^1^].
- Fixed a bug with OnRunStop firing at incorrect times in experiment child processes[^1^].
- Fixed a bug with setname () on subnodes of hashed-list nodes in C++[^1^].
- Fixed bug with applying the user commands window[^1^].
- Fixed a bug with sizes/locations sometimes being set to 0 when applying a properties windows that was opened through the right-click menu[^1^].
- Fixed the logevent () for receivefromport[^1^].
- Fixed an issue with the code editor's OnClose not asking for Apply[^1^].
- Other minor bug fixes from the development list[^1^].

## Updated Tree Version Number for Compatibility
 
In version 6, we made some changes to the tree structure that made it incompatible with previous versions of FlexSim, but we forgot to increment the tree version flag in the engine. For 6.0.2, we have fixed that bug by incrementing the version flag correctly. This makes it so that old versions of FlexSim properly give an error instead of crashing when trying to open new tree files[^1^]. Because of this change, FlexSim 6.0.0 will be unable to open 6.0.2 models. If you have trouble opening a model, be sure to upgrade to 6.0.2.
  
## Improved Dashboard and Chart Display
 
We have also made some improvements to the dashboard and chart display in FlexSim 6.0.2. Some of these improvements include:

- Fixed some display issues with bar charts in the dashboard[^1^].
- Changed the recorder pie chart's colors to match the state chart[^1^].
- Fixed some user interface quirks with the new trigger editor popup[^1^].

## Enhanced Task Sequence Options
 
We have also enhanced some of the task sequence options in FlexSim 6.0.2. Some of these enhancements include:

- Fixed a bug with the Fluid Ticker if you create a tick in 0 time[^1^].
- Changed several task sequence picklist options to default 8cf37b1e13
