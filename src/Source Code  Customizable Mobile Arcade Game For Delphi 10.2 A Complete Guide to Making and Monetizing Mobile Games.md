## What You Need
 
To follow this tutorial, you will need the following:
 
- A computer with Windows 10 and Delphi 10.2 installed.
- An Android or iOS device with USB debugging enabled.
- A USB cable to connect your device to your computer.
- The source code of the game, which you can download from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/delphigamestudio/CustomizableArcadeGame).

## How to Create the Game
 
The game we are going to create is a simple arcade shooter where you have to avoid or destroy the enemies that come from the top of the screen. You can move your spaceship left or right by swiping on the screen, and you can shoot by tapping on the screen. You can also collect power-ups that give you extra lives, shields, or weapons.
 
The game consists of three main units: Main.pas, Game.pas, and Settings.pas. The Main unit contains the main form of the application, where you can start or pause the game, access the settings, or exit the app. The Game unit contains the logic and graphics of the game, such as creating and moving the sprites, detecting collisions, playing sounds, and updating the score. The Settings unit contains the form where you can customize the game parameters, such as the number and speed of enemies, the type and frequency of power-ups, and the background music and sound effects.
