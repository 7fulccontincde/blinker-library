# How to Use T Splines in SolidWorks
 
T splines are a type of spline that can create complex and smooth curves in SolidWorks. They are based on B-splines and style splines, which are two different ways of defining and controlling the curves. In this article, we will explain what t splines are, how they differ from B-splines and style splines, and how to use them in SolidWorks.
  
## What are T Splines?
 
T splines are a type of spline that can create complex and smooth curves in SolidWorks. They are based on B-splines and style splines, which are two different ways of defining and controlling the curves.

A spline is a curve that passes through or near a set of points. It can be used to create organic shapes, such as car bodies, furniture, or jewelry. Splines can also be used to create smooth transitions between other sketch entities, such as lines, arcs, or circles.
 
The SOLIDWORKS software supports two types of splines: B-splines and style splines[^1^].
  
### B-splines
 
B-splines are the default type of splines in SolidWorks. You can use B-splines to create complex curves with multiple through points and spans (the region between through points). You can define and modify them using several controls, including spline points, spline handles, and control polygons[^1^].
 
A spline point is a point that the spline passes through. You can add or delete spline points by using the Spline Tools toolbar or the right-click menu. You can also drag spline points to change their position.
 
A spline handle is a graphical representation of the tangency direction and weight at each spline point. Tangency direction is the angle of the spline relative to the X, Y, or Z axis. Tangency weight is the influence of the tangency direction on the curvature of the spline. You can use spline handles to manipulate the shape of the spline by dragging them or using the Spline PropertyManager[^2^].
 
A control polygon is a polygon that connects the spline points. It shows the general shape of the spline. You can use control polygon handles to adjust the position of the spline points[^2^].
  
### Style Splines
 
Style splines are another type of splines in SolidWorks. They are based on BÃ©zier curves, which are a mathematical way of creating smooth curves. You can use style splines to create smooth and robust surfaces, especially when it is important to have curvature continuity (that is, no sharp changes in curvature). Style splines are available in 2D and 3D sketches[^1^].

You define and control style splines using control vertices. The control vertices form a control polygon, or hull of the curve. There are no through points, so a style spline has only one span between the endpoints[^1^].
 
You can inference style splines for tangency or equal curvature with other sketch entities. You can also constrain the control vertices and dimension the sides of the control polygon. These features allow you to create precise and symmetrical shapes with style splines[^1^].
  
## How to Use T Splines in SolidWorks?
 
T splines are a type of style splines that have some additional features. They allow you to create smooth curves with fewer control vertices, which makes them easier to edit and manipulate. They also let you insert or delete control vertices without changing the shape of the curve. T splines can be converted to B-splines or NURBS (non-uniform rational B-splines), which are widely used in CAD/CAM applications.
 
To use t splines in SolidWorks, you need to install a plug-in called T-Splines for SolidWorks. This plug-in adds a new toolbar and menu to SolidWorks that let you create and edit t splines. You can download a free trial version from [https://www.tsplines.com/solidworks/](https://www.tsplines.com/solidworks/).
 
Once you have installed the plug-in, you can follow these steps to create a t spline:
