# Hdrshop 3 0: A Powerful Tool for Creating and Manipulating High-Dynamic Range Images
 
High-dynamic range (HDR) images are images that have a greater range of brightness values than can be displayed on a standard monitor or captured by a conventional camera. HDR images can represent scenes with high contrast, such as a cathedral interior with light streaming through stained-glass windows, or scenes where the light sources are visible, such as a sunset or a night sky. HDR images also have the advantage of being proportional to the amount of light in the real world, unlike most regular images that are nonlinearly encoded.

Hdrshop 3 0 is an interactive graphical user interface image processing and manipulation system designed to create, view and manipulate HDR images. It was developed by the University of Southern California's Institute for Creative Technologies and is available for free for academic or non-commercial purposes. Hdrshop 3 0 can also be used as an advanced and very rapid image viewer for all common low/high dynamic range formats, including almost every current RAW digital camera image format.
 
Hdrshop 3 0 allows users to perform many simple and complex mathematical, filtering, and other useful image processing operations on single and multiple images with floating point accuracy and readout through a simple but powerful user interface. The software also supports scripting and is extensible via user-written plugins. Some of the features of Hdrshop 3 0 include:
 
- Camera curve calibration: Users can figure out their camera's light response curve by taking multiple images of a scene with different exposure settings and combining them into an HDR image.
- HDR image assembly: Users can create an HDR image by combining differently exposed images taken with a standard camera.
- Panoramic image transformations: Users can convert an HDR panorama between various layouts, such as spherical, cylindrical, cubic, or angular.
- Creating a light probe image: Users can create a light probe image (i.e. an HDR panorama) from one or two images of a mirrored ball.
- Diffuse and specular convolution: Users can convolve their HDR panorama with a diffuse or specular kernel to simulate different lighting effects.
- HDR image editing: Users can use a traditional image editor such as Adobe Photoshop to edit HDR images through Hdrshop 3 0.
- Tone mapping: Users can convert an HDR image to a low-dynamic range (LDR) image that can be displayed on a standard monitor or printed by using various tone-mapping algorithms.

Hdrshop 3 0 is a powerful tool for creating and manipulating HDR images that can be used for various applications, such as computer graphics, photography, film production, architecture, art, and science.
