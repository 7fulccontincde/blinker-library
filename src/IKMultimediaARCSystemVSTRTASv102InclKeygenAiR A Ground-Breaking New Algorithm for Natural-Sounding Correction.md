IK Multimedia ARC System VST RTAS v1.0.2 Incl Keygen-AiR is a software package that aims to improve the accuracy and quality of your studio monitors by correcting the acoustic problems of your room. It consists of a measurement microphone, a software plug-in, and a calibration file that you can load into your DAW.
 
The ARC System works by analyzing the frequency response of your room using the measurement microphone and the software plug-in. It then creates a correction curve that compensates for the unwanted peaks and dips in your room's acoustics. You can apply this correction curve to your monitor output using the software plug-in or the calibration file.

The ARC System claims to offer several benefits for music producers and engineers, such as:
 
- More balanced and natural sound from your monitors
- Better mixing and mastering decisions
- Less ear fatigue and listening fatigue
- More consistent results across different listening environments

The ARC System is compatible with most DAWs and audio interfaces that support VST or RTAS plug-ins. It requires Windows XP/Vista/7 or Mac OS X 10.4 or higher, as well as an internet connection for activation. The package includes a measurement microphone with a tripod stand, a USB cable, a software CD-ROM, and a user manual.
 
The ARC System is available for purchase from IK Multimedia's website or authorized dealers for $299 USD. You can also download a free trial version from their website to test it out before buying.
  
To use the ARC System, you need to follow these steps:

1. Install the software plug-in and the calibration file on your computer.
2. Connect the measurement microphone to your audio interface using the USB cable.
3. Launch your DAW and load the ARC System plug-in on your master output channel.
4. Follow the instructions on the plug-in's interface to measure your room at different positions.
5. Save the measurement data and choose a correction curve that suits your preference.
6. Enable the ARC System plug-in and enjoy your improved monitor sound.

The ARC System is easy to set up and use, and it can make a noticeable difference in your monitor sound. However, it is not a magic solution that can fix all your room's acoustic problems. You still need to apply some basic acoustic treatment to your room, such as placing bass traps, diffusers, and absorbers at strategic locations. The ARC System can help you get away with fewer panels or bass traps than it would take to get your room completely flat[^1^], but it cannot eliminate all the reflections, resonances, and modes that affect your sound quality.

The ARC System is also not a substitute for using reference tracks, headphones, or other monitors to check your mixes. You still need to compare your mixes with other sources and listen to them in different environments to make sure they translate well. The ARC System can help you achieve more balanced and natural sound from your monitors, but it cannot guarantee that your mixes will sound good everywhere.
 
The ARC System is a useful tool for music producers and engineers who want to improve their monitor sound and make better mixing and mastering decisions. It is not a perfect solution, but it can offer some significant benefits for a reasonable price. If you are interested in trying out the ARC System, you can download a free trial version from IK Multimedia's website or buy it from their online store or authorized dealers.
