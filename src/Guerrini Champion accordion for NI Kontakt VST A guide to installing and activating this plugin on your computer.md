One of the most important features of this instrument is the dynamic bellow control, which allows you to simulate the natural movement of the accordion bellow. You can control this effect by using an expression pedal connected to your MIDI keyboard, or by using a MIDI CC message. The bellow control also affects the vibrato, which is a left hand effect that makes the sound more expressive. You can also create a natural "suffocate" tone effect by releasing all keys quickly.
