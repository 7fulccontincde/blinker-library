One of the most recent versions of CYPE software is the 2009.1p version, which includes several improvements and new features that enhance the performance and functionality of the programs. Some of the main improvements in the 2009.1p version are:
 
- Adaptation to the changes in the CTE (Spanish technical building code), especially regarding safety in case of fire.
- Implementation of new wind and seismic loading codes for different countries, such as Canada, Algeria and Panama.
- Improvements in the ultimate limit state reports of aluminium sections, including checks for shear buckling and shear and bending effects.
- Implementation of the snow accumulation effect for snow load calculations according to RSA (Portugal) and Eurocode 1 (Portugal).

The 2009.1p version also includes a professional version, an evaluation version and a temporary license version, which can be downloaded from the CYPE website[^1^]. The evaluation version allows users to test the programs for a limited period of time, while the temporary license version allows users to work with the programs for a specific project or contract.
 
CYPE software is constantly updated to meet the needs and demands of the architecture, engineering and construction sector. CYPE 2009.1p is an example of how CYPE strives to provide high-quality technical software that complies with the latest standards and regulations.
  
CYPE software covers three fundamental areas in the elaboration of the project: structural design and analysis, design and analysis of building services, and project management and project documents. CYPE offers different programs for each area, such as CYPECAD, CYPE 3D, CYPECAD MEP, Arquimedes and many others. Each program has specific features and capabilities that suit different types of projects and requirements.
 
One of the main advantages of CYPE software is that it is integrated in the Open BIM workflow via the BIMserver.center platform. This means that CYPE programs can work with a 3D model of the building that is shared and updated by all the project participants. This allows for a collaborative, multidisciplinary and coordinated design process that improves the quality and efficiency of the project. CYPE software also supports interoperability with other BIM tools through standard formats such as IFC, DXF, DWG and XML.
 
CYPE software is constantly updated to meet the needs and demands of the architecture, engineering and construction sector. CYPE releases new versions every year that include new features, improvements and adaptations to the latest standards and regulations. For example, the latest version of CYPE software is the 2022 version, which includes new features such as CYPE Architecture, a new program for architectural design; CYPELEC PV Systems, a new program for photovoltaic system design; and CYPEHVAC Ductwork, a new program for ductwork design[^3^].
