## What is Roll Forming and Why Use UBECO PROFIL?
 
Roll forming is a process of shaping sheet or strip metal into desired cross-sectional profiles by passing it through a series of rollers. Roll forming is suitable for producing long or large quantities of parts with consistent quality and accuracy. Roll forming can also create complex shapes that are difficult or impossible to achieve by other methods.
 
UBECO PROFIL is a software that can help you design roll-formed profiles or seamed tubes from sheet metal. It can help you with the following tasks:

- Drawing the profile shape and dimensions in a CAD-like environment.
- Calculating the flower pattern, which is the sequence of bending steps required to form the profile.
- Designing the roll tooling, which is the set of rollers that perform the bending steps.
- Generating the drawings and 3D models of the profile, the flower pattern and the roll tooling.
- Performing finite element analysis (FEA) of the roll forming process to simulate the material deformation, stress, strain and springback.
- Optimizing the roll forming parameters to reduce material waste, production time and cost.

UBECO PROFIL can help you create high-quality roll-formed products with ease and efficiency. It can also help you avoid common problems in roll forming, such as buckling, twisting, cracking, edge waviness and dimensional inaccuracies.
  
## How to Use UBECO PROFIL?
 
UBECO PROFIL has a user-friendly interface that guides you through the steps of roll form design. You can start by creating a new project and entering the basic information about your profile, such as material type, thickness, width and length. You can also import an existing profile drawing from another CAD system via DXF or STEP file formats.
 
Next, you can draw your profile shape and dimensions using various drawing tools and commands. You can also modify your profile shape by adding or deleting elements, changing angles or radii, moving or copying elements and more. You can also use predefined shapes from the library or create your own custom shapes.
 
After drawing your profile shape, you can calculate your flower pattern by clicking on the "Flower" button. UBECO PROFIL will automatically generate the optimal bending steps for your profile based on your material properties and bending parameters. You can also adjust the bending parameters manually or use predefined values from the database.
 
Next, you can design your roll tooling by clicking on the "Rolls" button. UBECO PROFIL will automatically generate the roll contours for each bending step based on your profile shape and dimensions. You can also modify the roll contours manually or use predefined contours from the library. You can also specify the roll dimensions, such as diameter, width and pitch.
 
After designing your roll tooling, you can generate the drawings and 3D models of your profile, flower pattern and roll tooling by clicking on the "Drawings" button. UBECO PROFIL will automatically create detailed drawings and 3D models in various views and formats. You can also export your drawings and 3D models to another CAD system via DXF or STEP file formats.
 
Finally, you can perform FEA of your roll forming process by clicking on the "FEA" button. UBECO PROFIL will automatically create a mesh model of your profile and apply the boundary conditions and loads according to your flower pattern and roll tooling. You can also modify the mesh model manually or use predefined settings from the database. You can then run the FEA simulation using LS-DYNA solver (included in UBECO PROFIL package) and view the results using LS-PrePost viewer (also included). You can analyze various aspects of your roll forming process, such as deformation, stress, strain and springback.
