5. Edit the "config.ini" file with a text editor. You need to change some settings to make the emulator work properly. For example, you need to specify the path of the ROM files, the screen resolution, the sound volume, and the coin denomination. You can also change some other options according to your preference.
6. Save and close the "config.ini" file.
7. Create a shortcut for the "mk6emu.exe" file on your desktop or anywhere else you want.
8. Double-click on the shortcut to launch the emulator. You should see a window with a list of available games.
9. Select a game and click on "Play". The game should start loading and running on your PC.
10. Use your keyboard or mouse to control the game. You can insert coins by pressing "5", start spinning by pressing "1", bet max by pressing "2", and collect by pressing "3". You can also use other keys for other functions.
