# Outbreak: Undead - A Survival Horror Roleplaying Game
 
Outbreak: Undead is a roleplaying game that lets you create and play as yourself in a zombie apocalypse scenario. You can use your own skills, abilities, and personality traits to survive the undead horde. You can also customize the zombies, the setting, and the rules to fit your preferred style of play. Outbreak: Undead is a game of survival, not heroism. You will have to make tough choices, face moral dilemmas, and deal with the consequences of your actions.

If you are looking for a realistic, immersive, and challenging zombie roleplaying game, Outbreak: Undead is the game for you. You will have to use your wits, your skills, and your resources to survive. You will have to face the horror of the undead, as well as the horror of humanity. You will have to ask yourself: What would you do in a zombie outbreak?

The second edition of Outbreak: Undead is a revised and improved version of the original game, with more options, more content, and more flexibility. The second edition consists of two core books: the Survivors Guide for players and the Game Masters Guide for GMs. The Survivors Guide contains everything you need to create and play your own character, using either a pre-generated archetype or your own SPEW-AI personality test. You can also customize your character's skills, gear, and tactics, as well as learn how to use survival points, competence points, and risk to influence the game. The Survivors Guide also introduces the Strain System, a modular way of creating different types of zombies and scenarios for your game.
